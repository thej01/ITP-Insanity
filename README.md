**This is not a reimplementation of the scrapped insanity mechanic, instead a reimagining.**

*The pit will now slowly make you lose your mind...*

*Do you know what's real or not anymore?*

This mod adds several audio hallucinations to the game, and a few visual ones. All controlled by an invisible "Insanity Meter".

**This mod is best experienced blind, but if you wish the mechanics are listed below.**

**Remember... don't trust anything!**

        You slowly gain insanity in the pit overtime, depending on difficulty, it may be faster.
        Other things will give insanity as well, such as tripping, luring springbonnie, and being in dark rooms.

        Insanity can also be decreased by using your flashlight, same with being out of the pit.
        It's a little more complicated than this, but I don't feel like listing it all.
